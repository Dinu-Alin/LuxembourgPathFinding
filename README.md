# Luxembourg Path Finding

The application visually displays the map of Luxembourg in a window, receiving the coordinates from an xml file. The start and end points of the road are selected by mouse click in 2 different areas of the map by the user, and the algorithm displays the shortest path.
To choose between the two algorithms (Dijkstra or Bellman-Ford), you can enter the algorithm option in the console.
The time to load the graph from the file and display it in the window should be about one second.
Also, the execution time of the shortest path algorithm and the resulting path staining is extremely short.
